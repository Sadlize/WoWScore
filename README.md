# WowScore

This project is an assistant for World of Warcraft players that analyzes the current progress of the player's character
and showing which keys must be closed to be in the cutoffs (0.1% of the best players)

WoWScore also helps you plan your key closing strategy by providing additional stats for affixes, weeks and more.
